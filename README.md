# Boston_Airbnb
Brief analysis and linear model based on Boston Airbnb price data

## Libraries

To run this project, the following libraries are needed:

-Matplotlib
-Numpy
-Pandas
-scikit-learn
-Seaborn

## Project Motivation

I was interested in deriving the following insights from the Boston Airbnb database:

1. Which are the neighbourhoods in the city offering more rental locations?
2. What is the average price for each neighbourhood?
3. Despite of the prive level, which are the neighbourhoods generating more income from Airbnb rentals?
4. Are there any measurable factors driving the price of listings? Can a model be built to predict prices?

## File Descriptions

The original dataset was obtained from Kaggle on the [following link](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/airbnb/boston)

There are 4 notebooks available here where the steps to address each question are shown. The files will walk you through the lines of code and the actions they are performing. 

## Results

The main findings of the code can be found at the post available [here](https://medium.com/@mreyes9406/how-much-will-you-make-by-renting-your-place-in-boston-6e4749f33a62).

## Licensing

Must give credit to Kaggle and Airbnb for the data.
